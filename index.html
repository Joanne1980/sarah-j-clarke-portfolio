        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <P>I have just started the Front-end web developement bootcamp. I have been interested in learning to code for quite a while
           and thought it was about time I learned. I do not have any experience as yet but I am very eager for that to change and for me to build
           portfolio that will help me to take on lots of projects going forward. I am a mum to three beautiful girls so any spare time I spend with 
           them going on days out, swimming. long walks, cooking.</p>
