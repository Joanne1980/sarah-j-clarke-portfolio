# sarah-j-clarke-portfolio

## Description.
Portfolio of my progress during the front-end web development bootcamp and the I will use it for any projects I am part of in order to help me in my future job roles and to gain work. I have very much enjoyed working on this and look forward to improving it as my knowledge grows. 

## Table of content. 
The first section is my about me section at the moment I havent got much to say regarding web development as I do not have much experience but this will improve greatly by the time I finish this course.
Section two is my work section I currently only have two projects linked and have placeholders in for two as I do not have the work to link up. As I produce more work I will update. 
Section three is my contact details.
